# BF-slider

## My task
I had to make a Slider using HTML, CSS, SASS and jQuery.

## Functionality
Slider moves left and right depending on which arrow we click.
Pictures have to move for the width of right(last) picture in a row.

Slider is specific because it comes out of Wrapper and floats to the left side 
of the screen. The last right picture is actually a picture in focus.
The slider is infinite, in the sense that on the first position always comes picture 
which came out of the viewport.
This applies to each row separately.
Clicking on a single arrow moves both rows at the same time.
